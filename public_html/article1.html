  <h2>  Myanmar <small> Sept 29. - Oct 15. </small> </h2>

  On Friday the 29th we left Zurich in the evening and arrived in Bangkok on Saturday morning. Sunday we took a 1.5 hour flight
  to Mandalay, Myanmar. The road was rather bumpy, the landscape green, uninhabited and flat. Everybody in Myanmar, men and women,
   wear a kind of skirt called "longyi" and all the women and children have a paste on their face as decoration and sun protection.
  We ambled around, not sure what to do, when a shirtless, chubby guy on a scooter addressed us and asked us if we needed a taxi.
  We agreed and he arranged for a car. He introduced himself as Mr Shaw. As our tour guide he sat in the trunk and pointed out the sights in incomprehensible english.
  Most memorable sights in Mandalay and the vicinity:
  a giant pile of bricks aka what was supposed to be a huge religious structure one day but got destroyed in an earthquake.
  big white pagoda, that hurt to look at because it was so bright
  U Bein bridge, the worlds longest teak bridge
  "the garden center" a religious complex encompassing over 2000 uniform stupas in neat rows
  etc
  After three nights in Mandalay we moved on to Bagan. How? Cramped, with Mr Shaw in the trunk as always, burping in my ear.
  The ride was intense (the driving style in Myanmar is crazy compared to CH) but fun. We also ran over a snake.
  Bagan in three words: CO2, dusty, incredible.
  We rolled around the countryside on "E-bikes", actually electric scooters, inhaled lots of exhaust fumes, ate extremely oily food
  and saw hundreds of pagodas. The pagodas on their own turned into a blur after a while. My favorite was not one individual pagoda,
  but the view of them all in the sunset. That was really breathtaking.
  Less impressive was the sleeping situation. All the hotels were full, due to a buddhist festival. The first night we slept in a locals house the second int a monastery.
  Flat wooden table = bed, a basin of water supplied with plastic bowls to pour water over oneself = community shower, nonexistent wifi, unreliable electricity
  and awful monk music blasting 24/7. Sounded like a kid screeching in a mic.
  Next stop was Nyaung Shwe, situated north of Inle Lake. We took the night bus and arrived very early in the morning.
  The hotel staff here was very friendly and always offered us snacks and tea.
  Early one morning we took a boat out on the lake with some frenchies to see a buddhist procession. The floats were big boats
  with around 80 men aboard, rowing and dancing to the same music we had heard in Bagan. The end of the parade was marked
  by a big, floating, golden temple. The rest of the day we went to different workshops: weaving, silversmith, boat making, cigar and bamboo.
  Not all too interesting. Then we visited the floating tomato gardens and passed through villages on stilts. In the afternoon we went down
  a river to a town (Inthein) with a pagoda on a hill, surrounded by hundreds of mismatched stupas. The way up passed through
  a bamboo forest and lots of vendors trying to sell stuff. Chris got a hat decorated with teeth and boar tusks. We also saw
  Shan people (a tribe), who all wear a folded scarf on their head.
  Other days we rented bikes and went on a bike rides in and around Nyaung Schwe. We also visited the local market, where they sell
  fresh fruits and vegetables, fish (still flopping around), clothes, pharmaceuticals and everything else you can think of.
  They also gutted and chopped up chicken right there.
  With the night bus again we went on to Pyin Oo Lwin, a colonial town in the mountains near to Mandalay. There wasn't much to do there, we just
  rode around on bikes again and visited the National Gardens which was nice. Notes: they still use horse carts, the times on the train schedule
  are just a guess, there is no difference between yoghurt, milkshake, milk or lassi.
  The next day we visited a waterfall. We had to walk down on a steep, muddy (bec it had rained the whole night) path to reach them.
  By the time we got back we were drenched in sweat from the humidity. Then we took a taxi back to Mandalay and just hung around because
  the monsoon season had flooded the streets.
